They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.

They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:   Why the government is proposing to intervene;  The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;  How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,  The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.
