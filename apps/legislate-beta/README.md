# Legislate?! v1.2 (stable)

- White UI, SVG board wrapper; tokens move one space at a time.
- Blocking card modal; OK required to continue.
- Admin panel (collapsed by default, password `legislate` â€” no visible hints).
- **Wizard-style calibration**: step-by-step, stage+deck inline, big numbered colour markers, Back button, progress tracking.
- Export generates a single `board.json` (`index,x,y,stage,deck`) using your chosen **Total spaces**.

> We do **not** ship your `assets/board.png` to avoid overwriting your existing calibrated board. Keep your current file in place.
