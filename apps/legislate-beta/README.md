# Legislate?! v1.2

- White UI, SVG board wrapper, tokens move **one space at a time**.
- Floating black & white die with ~2.5s animation.
- Cards: 5 decks with blocking modal (OK-to-continue).
- Admin (password: `legislate`): calibration (58 points), **mini-editor per space**, **Walk Mode**, **highlight ring**, and a **progress bar with exact counts**; Export disabled until 58/58 are configured.
- Combined export: `board.json` now stores `deck` inside each space item.
